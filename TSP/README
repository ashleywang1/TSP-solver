This is the README file for the research project submitted 
to the 2012 Siemens Competition.

DISCLAIMER: The author is free from any liability involving the use
of the project results.


======================
Background Information
======================


The research project was based on two codes in the public domain: 

(1) ACOTSP-1.0.2
Thomas Stuetzle. ACOTSP, Version 1.0.2 Available from
http://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/aco-code, 2004.

  The original ACOTSP code will always be referred to as ACOTSP-1.0.2
  The modified ACOTSP code wll always be referred to as ACOTSP

(2) LKH-2.0.6
The LKH code can be found online at 
http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/

  During the earlier stages of the research project, LKH-2.0.5 was used.
  The current results are consistent with the LKH-2.0.6 version. No changes
  were made to the LKH-2.0.6 code.

  Although LKH-2.0.6 can be incorporated into m-ACOTSP by replacing the 
  local search component (ls.c), the integration of the two codes needs 
  more testing. 

Compilation of ACOTSP:
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: 
	tar xvfz acotsp.tgz
	cd acotsp
	make
An executable file called acotsp will now be available in the directory acotsp.

Compilation of LKH-2.0.6:
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: 
	tar xvfz LKH-2.0.6.tgz
	cd LKH-2.0.6
	make
An executable file called LKH will now be available in the directory LKH-2.0.6.

TSPLIB:
  A collection of TSP files from

  Other TSP files include the mona-lisa100K.tsp from
    http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/data/ml/monalisa.html
  and 115,475 Towns and Cities in the United States usa115475.tsp from
    http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/data/usa/index.html

doc:
  A collection of papers and manuals relevant to the project.

opt.tour:
  A collection of optimal tour files (compatible with LKH format).
  LKH format (for input or output) has 6 lines at the beginning, while 
  other published opt.tour files have only 5 top lines. For TSP 
  instances without knowing optimality, the length of the tour replaces
  .opt., such as monalisa.5757191.tour.

bin:
  Two executable files: ACOTSP and LKH.
  Source codes: filename.c and filename.h
  A record of their changes: filename.change  

mMMAS:
  To use this option, the modified-MIN-MAX ant system must be activated
  using -n in the command line.

  Example: dsj1000.tsp, a random clustered TSP constructed by Johnson. 
	Note: The TSP instance uses CEIL_2D, in which weights are 
	Euclidean distances in 2-D (EUC_2D) rounded up. There is a bug 
	in ACOTSP1.0.2 for this calculation (confirmed through e-mail 
	communications with the original author of ACOTSP).
  Note: Running the dsj1000.tsp using the windows version of CONCORDE from
    http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm 
  uses an EUC_2D setting. 

2-opt-p:
  To use this setting, the local search flag has to be activated
  using -l 4 in the command line.  
	Note: Two extra parameters delta1 = 0.05 and delta2 = 0.1
	have been added in order to reduce the running time.

  Examples: att48.tsp, eil51.tsp, berlin52.tsp, bier127.tsp, ch130.tsp,
  ch150.tsp, gr202.tsp, gr229.tsp, pr439.tsp, att532.tsp, ali535.tsp, d657.tsp 

LKHsolo:
  This runs the code LKH-2.0.6. The command to run the code is 
	./LKH instancename.par
  The results can be seen by using the command 
	grep "Length" *.tour
 
ACOsolo:
  This runs the code ACOTSP. The command to run the code is
	./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -z (or -x or -n)
  Note: Other parameters can be found in the manual for acotsp-1.0.2
  The results can be found using the command
	grep "Best try" best*
  or
	grep "LENGTH" *.tour
  An optional input is the instancename.tour file. The output of this code
  is an instancename.ant.tour file.
 
QnD:
  This follows the quick-and-dirty ACO approach. The command to run the code is
	./LKH instancename.par
  In the filename.par file, there is the line:
  INPUT_TOUR_FILE = instancename.ant.tour
  The instancename.ant.tour file can be generated from the acotsp code.
  The output of this code is an instancename.tour file.
 
mMMAS-LKH:
  This follows the modified-acotsp with an LKH local search approach.
  The results were generated by iteratively running two codes, with the
  acotsp code first and the LKH code last.
  The instancename.ant.tour file generated by the acotsp code becomes 
  the input for the LKH code. The instancename.tour file generated by
  the LKH code becomes the input for the acotsp code.

      Version: 1.02
      Author:  Thomas Stuetzle

This is the README file to the software package ACOTSP.

This software package was developed by Thomas Stuetzle in connection
with the Book 

[DorStu04] Marco Dorigo and Thomas Stuetzle, "Ant Colony
Optimization", MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA, 2004.

The software package is freely available subject to the 
GNU General Public Licence, which is included in file gpl.txt.

If you use ACOTSP in your research, I would appreciate a citation in
your publication(s). Please cite it as

Thomas Stuetzle. ACOTSP, Version 1.0. Available from
http://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/aco-code, 2004.

This software package provides an implementation of various Ant Colony
Optimization (ACO) algorithms for the symmetric Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). The ACO algorithms implemented are Ant System,
Elitist Ant System, MAX-MIN Ant System, Rank-based version of Ant
System, Best-Worst Ant System, and Ant Colony System. This is Version
1.0 of ACOTSP; it is in large part identical to the software used to
produce the results in [DorStu04], but it has been slightly adapted to
make the code more readable, more comments were added, and a new
command line parser was generated with opag.

AIMS OF THE SOFTWARE: This software was developed to have one common
code for the various known ACO algorithms that were at some point
applied to the TSP in the literature. The software tries to provide a
reasonably efficient implementation of these ACO algorithms while at
the same time aiming for readability and understandability of the
code.


UPDATES for version 1.02: (Manuel Lopez-Ibanez)

- Avoid rounding issues that may rarely result in broken tours.
  (ants.c: neighbour_choose_and_move_to_next)

- The termination condition is now checked after every local search
  call. (acotsp.c: local_search)

- Avoid division by zero. (ants.c: bwas_pheromone_mutation)

- Defaults for all algorithms follow those given in the ACO book.

- The type of timer can be selected when building. Either
  'make TIMER=dos' or 'make TIMER=unix'.

- New command-line flags: --quiet and --seed

- Information about command-line options is printed to stdout. Only
  errors are printed in stderr.

- Fix various compiler warnings.


UPDATES for version 1.01:

- corrected a memory leak on 64 bit architectures (file ls.c, line 83,
  changed int to long int)

- corrected a problem in MMAS pheromone update (file acotsp.c, line 406, condition corrected to  
        if ( u_gb == 1 && (iteration - restart_found_best > 50))
	)

- corrected a problem in BWAS update (file acotsp.c, line 406, procedure call should read   
        bwas_worst_ant_update( &ant[iteration_worst_ant], best_so_far_ant );
	)	

- corrected a problem in option parsing (file parse.c, line 1032 should read 	
        check_out_of_range( nn_ants, 1, 100, "nn_ants");
	)

Thanks to the various users who have reported these problems!

=====
Code
=====


The software was developed in ANSI C under Linux, using the GNU 2.95.3
gcc compiler and extensively tested in this environment. The software
is distributed as a gzipped tar file.

To install the code, first obtain the file ACOTSP.V1.0.tar.gz. Unzip
the file by typing

gunzip ACOTSP.V1.0.tar.gz

and then unpack it by typing 

tar -xvf ACOTSP.V1.0.tar

The software will unpack in a new folder ACOTSP.V1.0 

To compile it under Linux just type 'make' and the executable 'acotsp'
is produced.

Note: The code is written in ANSI C. Hence, the code should be
reasonable portable to other Operating Systems than Linux or Unix.


======
USAGE
======


Given the large number of ACO algorithms, also the number of command
line options is relatively large.

The default parameter settings are such, that MAX-MIN Ant System will
be run using a 3-opt local search, using alpha = 1, beta = 2, rho =
0.5 for a maximum of 10 seconds per each trial for 10 independent
trials. (guess who developed MAX-MIN Ant System ;-)

The executable 'acotsp' provides the following command line options
(given are the short and the long options):

-r, --tries          # number of independent trials
-s, --tours          # number of steps in each trial
-t, --time           # maximum time for each trial
    --seed           # seed for the random number generator 
-i, --tsplibfile     f inputfile (TSPLIB format necessary)
-o, --optimum        # stop if tour better or equal optimum is found
-m, --ants           # number of ants
-g, --nnants         # nearest neighbours in tour construction
-a, --alpha          # alpha (influence of pheromone trails)
-b, --beta           # beta (influence of heuristic information)
-e, --rho            # rho: pheromone trail evaporation
-q, --q0             # q_0: prob. of best choice in tour construction
-c, --elitistants    # number of elitist ants
-f, --rasranks       # number of ranks in rank-based Ant System
-k, --nnls           # No. of nearest neighbors for local search
-l, --localsearch    0: no local search   1: 2-opt   2: 2.5-opt   3: 3-opt
-d, --dlb            1 use don't look bits in local search
-u, --as               apply basic Ant System
-v, --eas              apply elitist Ant System
-w, --ras              apply rank-based version of Ant System
-x, --mmas             apply MAX-MIN ant system
-y, --bwas             apply best-worst ant system
-z, --acs              apply ant colony system
-n, --mmmas            apply modified MMAS system (added by Ashley Wang)
-j, --mmmaslkh         apply modified ACO and LKH (added by Ashley Wang)
-h, --help             display the help text and exit

Options -u --as, -v --eas, -w --ras, -x --mmas, -y --bwas, -z --acs,
-h, --help don't need arguments, while all the others do.  

A Mandatory option is only the option "-i, --tsplibfile". Here, mandatory
means that without specifying this option, the program won't work,
since there is no input file. 

All the other options take some default values. The default values for
these are:

-r, --tries       : 10
-s, --tours       : 100
-t, --time        : 10 /* seconds */
-o, --optimum     : 1
-m, --ants        : 25
-g, --nnants      : 20
-a, --alpha       : 1
-b, --beta        : 2
-e, --rho         : 0.5
-q, --q0          : 0.0
-c, --elitistants : 100
-f, --rasranks    : 6
-k, --nnls        : 20
-l, --localsearch : 3 /* use 3-opt */
-d, --dlb         : 1 
-u, --as          : 0
-v, --eas         : 0
-w, --ras         : 0 
-x, --mmas        : 1 /* apply MAX-MIN Ant System */
-y, --bwas        : 0
-z, --acs         : 0


The default settings imply that as default MAX-MIN Ant System is run
using a 3-opt local search procedure. Please note that these default
values do not really make sense for some of the algorithms (e.g.,
typically an evaporation of 0.2 is recommended vor MAX-MIN Ant
System); that is, for some of the algorithms the default parameter
settings lead to poor performance (an example is ACS). Hence, when you
use any of the ACO algorithms, make sure you set the appropriate
parameter values. Typically, one may want to adjust the parameters

-t, --time
-o, --optimum
-m, --ants
-b, --beta
-e, --rho 
-q, --q0
-l, --localsearch

Note that only one option among -u --as, -v --eas, -w --ras,
-x --mmas, -y --bwas, -z --acs, is to be specified.

Examples for running an experiments are:

./acotsp -i lin318.tsp -v -t 60. -o 42029 -m 50 -b 5

or

./acotsp --tsplibfile lin318.tsp --acs --rho 0.1 --q0 0.95 --time 60. --optimum 42029 --ants 10


=======
OUTPUT
=======


Every experiment produces three files. These files are 

best.tsplibfilename
cmp.tsplibfilename
stat.tsplibfilename

where tsplibfilename is the instance identifier of the instance under
solution. 

The most important of these is the file "cmp.tsplibfilename". This
file starts with a specification of the parameter settings used to run
the experiment. The section with the comprehensive experimental data
starts with

begin problem tsplibfilename

Next the random number seed for the next trial is given

Then, for each trial statistical information on the development of the
best-so-far solution is given. Each section for a trial starts with

begin try <trial_number>

Then, each time the algorithm finds a new best solution a line 

best <number>	 iteration <number>	 tours <number>	 time <number>

is added, where "best" is the tour length of the best-so-far solution;
iteration is the iteration number in which this solution is found;
tours is the number of solutions constructed so far (typically this is
simple iteration X n_ants); and time is the time at which a new
best-so-far solution is found

Each trial is ended by 

end try <trial_number>

Once all trials are run the line 

end problem tsplibfilename

is added to end the file. 

The file  best.tsplibfilename

collects the information about parameter settings, the best solution
found in each trial, and some additional statistical information.

The file stat.tsplibfilename 

may be used for the output of statistical information on a trial as
generated by the procedure population_statistics(); in InOut.c;
however, it is not heavily used in ACOTSP V1.0.
